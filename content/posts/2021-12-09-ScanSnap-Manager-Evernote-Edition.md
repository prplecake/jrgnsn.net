title: ScanSnap Manager Evernote Edition
---

Some unknown[^1] amount of time ago, Fujitsu stopped supporting the
ScanSnap Manager Evernote Edition software. The scanner's still usable,
but you need to perform a firmware upgrade to be able to use it with
ScanSnap Home.

However, to be able to perform the firmware upgrade, you still need to
have the legacy ScanSnap Manager Evernote Edition software installed -
which isn't easy to find if you don't currently have it installed. If
you do have the legacy application installed, go ahead and follow the
instructions [on Fujitsu's
website](https://scansnap.fujitsu.com/global/evernote/index.html) to
complete the firmware upgrade.

If you don't have the legacy application currently installed, no
problem. I scoured the internet so you don't have to. You can still
download the legacy application [from Evernote's own
CDN](https://cdn1.evernote.com/scansnap/win/PFU_Scanner_Installer_b19.exe),
or, when that goes away, I've saved a copy of the latest installer. You
can get that from my [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10CMvELKLVccFU5Flep6HkzbOGohXsIXU).
