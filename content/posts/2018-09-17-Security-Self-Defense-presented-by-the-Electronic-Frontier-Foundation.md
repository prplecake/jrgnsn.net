For a while now, I've been aware of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation][eff]
(the EFF), and I make good use of a fair number of their projects. The
following is not an exhaustive list:

- [Privacy Tools][privacy-tools]
- [HTTPS Everywhere][https-everywhere]
- [Privacy Badger][privacy-badger]

I also follow a fair share of recommendations from [Privacy Tools][privacy-tools]
including using uMatrix and CookieAutoDelete.

Now I recently came across another of their projects that I will most
likely end up pointing people from now on. That project is Security
Self-Defense, and they have a plethora of how-to guides explaining how
to protect personal data and delete personal data. There's also a ton of
information on steps you can take to protect against hackers. One of my
favorite articles outlines [precautions to keep in mind at U.S. border
crossings](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/things-consider-when-crossing-us-border).

Check it out: [Security Self-Defense from the EFF](https://ssd.eff.org).
