## About The Author

As you may already know by now, my name is Matthew Jorgensen. I live in
St. Paul, MN. During the day I oversee a plethora of servers and
systems. By night, I explore my hobbies to help keep me busy. Most
notably, my hobbies include:

<div class="col-2-list"><ul>
<li>bicycling</li>
<li>camping</li>
<li>canoeing, kayaking, sailing</li>
<li>hiking</li>
<li>programming</li>
<li>photography</li>
<li>traveling</li>
<li>Linux systems administration; and,</li>
<li>software and web development</li>
</ul></div>

My fascination with computers, technology, and the Internet began at a
very young age. I began playing around with HTML/CSS and eventually PHP
*just as* MySpace was starting to fall out of style. The first CSS I
wrote was to style forums. I didn't start programming until about age 14.
That's when I started getting into PHP more until I found Python. My
skill set has greatly grown since then. I'm currently employed as a "Web
Developer/Systems Engineer" for a medical software company near
Minneapolis, MN.

These days I'm capable of writing[^1]:
Python, C#, Go, Shell scripts, PowerShell, JavaScript; and a bit of the
following: Ruby, Java, and PHP.

[^1]: Mostly in order of confidence.
