### For the pie crust:

In a food processor (or, if you don't have one of those, a large mixing
bowl and a pastry knife), blitz butter, shortening, sugar, flour, and
salt until the butter and shortening is about pea-sized. Pour in ice
water and mix until just combined. Transfer to a clean counter top and
divide into two equal pieces. Shape the discs and wrap with plastic
wrap. Let chill in the fridge for at least an hour.[^1]

Once chilled, remove from fridge and roll out until 1/4 inch think and
it fits your pie pan. Wrap your rolling pin with the pie crust to easily
roll out over the pie pan.

Gently shape the pie crust to meet the crevices of the pie pan. Use a
knife to trim edges of the pie crust, them crimp the sides or leave as
is. Use a fork to poke holes all along the bottom to prevent bubbled.
Cover the edge of the crust with aluminum foil to prevent burning the
edges. Bake at 325°F for about 10 minutes. The crust will shrink a
little bit, depending on your pan, so give it about 1/2 inch to an inch
to shrink down to. Remove from oven and set aside.

[^1]: This recipe makes two pie crusts (or a top and a bottom), so you
      have another pie crust for later, or you can double the filling recipe
      and make two pecan pies!

### To make the filling:

Preheat oven to 350°F.

In a skillet, melt coconut oil over medium heat. Toss pecans into pan
and stir until lightly coated in oil. Sprinkle cinnamon on top and
continue stirring until pecans are fragrant and lightly toasted (about
3-4 minutes). Watch carefully and stir constantly because they burn
really quickly. Remove from pan and set aside to cool. Roughly chop
pecans once cooler. You can reserve about 1/2 cup of them to leave on
top for decoration. 

In a small bowl, mix flax meal and warm water and let sit until
thickened and gelled (about 5 minutes).

In a small pot, combine white sugar, maple syrup, butter, flax mixture,
crackers, flour, and pecan pieces and stir over medium low heat until
sugar is dissolved and mixture is fairly thick (about 5 minutes). Turn
off heat, stir in vanilla extract, and transfer to par-baked pie shell.
Arrange pecan halves on top as desired. If you can, submerge them in the
sugar syrup a bit so that the pecan halves are protected from burning.

Keep edge of pie protected with aluminum foil, and bake for about 30-40
minutes. Remove aluminum foil from edges and continue to bake until
edges are golden and the pie filling is mostly set but a little jiggly
in the middle when you gently shake the pie - about another 10-15
minutes.

Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack. It's best to let it sit
until slightly warmed or completely cool before serving. Cut and enjoy!
