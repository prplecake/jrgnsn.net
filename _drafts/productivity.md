title: Productivity
---

For the past couple months I’ve felt relatively unproductive. But, I don’t think
it’s that I’ve been unproductive, I think this is more a case of the metrics
against which I judge productivity have changed and I’m starting to get used to
them. 

Like, I don’t feel as productive as I did after a day of construction, but maybe
that’s simple a difference between a [mandatory] 12-hr work day versus a much
more forgiving 8-hr day.

But of course, as a software magician, I don’t have much of a physical object to
show for. I can’t go for a drive and see the software I’ve built.

This is almost worthy of a blog post.
