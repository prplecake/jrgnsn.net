## Updates

### 2019-05-12

This project is what will eventually replace WordPress for
[VeganMSP.com]. I've been meaning to get my ideas onto paper, so I don't
lose them, but I'm still trying to figure out the requirements and the
best implementations of them. If you browse to the repository today,
you'll note it's bare. This project hasn't quite gotten its feet off the
ground yet.

Stay tuned for a post announcing the project in the coming weeks.
