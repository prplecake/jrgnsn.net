## About The Author

As you may already know by now, my name is Matthew Jorgensen. I live in
Minneapolis, MN and am currently doing IT for a medical trial software
company. During the day I oversee a plethora of servers and systems. By
night I explore my hobbies to help keep me busy. Most notably, my
hobbies include programming,
photography, Linux systems administration, and software and web
development.

Sometimes I get sick of being inside. Then, I'll typically be found
outside on my bicycle or longboard; or, I could be spotted hiking around
any one of the countless parks around me.

My fascination with computers, technology, and the Internet began at a
very young age.
