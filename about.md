## About The Author

As you may already know by now, my name is Matthew Jorgensen. I live in
Minneapolis, MN. During the day I oversee a plethora of servers and
systems. By night I explore my hobbies to help keep me busy. Most
notably, my hobbies include:

<div class="col-2-list"><ul>
<li>bicycling</li>
<li>camping</li>
<li>canoeing, kayaking, sailing</li>
<li>hiking</li>
<li>programming</li>
<li>photography</li>
<li>traveling</li>
<li>Linux systems administration; and,</li>
<li>software and web development</li>
</ul></div>

My fascination with computers, technology, and the Internet began at a
very young age. I began playing around with HTML/CSS and eventually PHP
*just as* myspace was starting to fall out of style. Some of the first
CSS I wrote was for forums. I didn't start programming for real until
about age 14. That's when I started getting into PHP a little more until
I found Python. My skill set has greatly grown since then. I'm currently
employed as a "Web Developer/Systems Engineer" for a medical software
company near Minneapolis, MN.
