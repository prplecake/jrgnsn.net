With protests, riots, vandalism, and community action erupting all over
Minneapolis in the last week, I have to do something. While my options
are limited, it's critical at times like these to document and record
*everything*. I wish I could have a live stream up outside on my porch
overlooking the intersection.

In the mean time, I've been taking pictures. Lots and *lots* of
pictures. I'm not on most social media, and they have the power to
censor their platforms at their discretion. I've been working on a web
application to share my photography over the last several months. It's
not as ready as I would hope it could be, but there's no time to delay.
The world needs to see what's going on, from as many angles as possible.

**[p.jrgnsn.net][0]** is my platform for sharing pictures and
photography. There's still a lot of work to be done, but it does it's
main job and it does it well: delivering my photography to you.
