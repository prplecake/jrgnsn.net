The blog got some visual updates! Most of the content is now a single
column, with any meta information, like my bio and external links, are
under the content.

I've added a webring, powered by [openring][0], which shares articles
from blogs I follow around the net.

I think the change I'm most thrilled with, is the CSS implements the
`prefers-color-scheme: dark` media feature. So for operating systems
that have a "dark mode", my website won't blind you!

Here's a little before and after:

There's still some improvements that could be made, but for now I how
everything turned out!
